**Welcome to Mack Pearson-Muggli's Portfolio! (Also known as chopov1 over the internet)**
>I am currently a student at Columbia College studying programming as an interactive art. This page is a collection of things I have or am currently working on.

      !!Please make sure to click the sound icon in the bottom right of the videos to hear sound as it is muted by default!!
>[My Itch.io Page](https://itch.io/profile/chopov1) is where you can play some of the games I have made for game jams. Typically I handle programming in c# & c++ as well as audio asset creation and implementation using ableton, fmod, wwise, unity and or unreal's built in sound engine. 



### This is my Game Audio Demo Reel. The second clip is a game I am currently working on by myself in Unreal Engine 4.

* *__8bit Breadboard Computer__* - This video shows a simple program running on an 8bit computer I put together following Ben Eater's tutorial series on youtube. This passion project took me the course of about a month to complete during the summer of my freshman year of college and taught me alot about the hardware side of programming. It also required me to put my critical thinking and problem solving skills to the test, in order to troubleshoot when things went wrong. The computer can add, subtract, retrieve and store data. The video shows me running a simple program in which the computer adds 2 and 1 giving us 3, takes that result and adds that to 2 giving us 5, then takes that result and subtracts 2 from it giving us 3. You can see the final result output to the display in Decimal.

* *__Wave File Generator__*  - This is a screenshot of a project I am currently working on in c++ with vscode. As of now it creates a new wave file, and writes data into the file. The algorithm that it uses to write data depends on the wave form the user enters. I hope to add a lot more wave forms and if anyone has any good sources on how to uncompress and read data from a wav file please reach out to me. I would love to expand this application to filtering existing files as well.

* *__Game2__*                 -
      Game2 is a simulation game I created in c# where you play as a merchant selling potions to townsfolk. ![Screenshot (64)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76492881/126075050-2ec8abc6-b5c9-4271-b529-21585ebc9b3d.png)
      I also implemented sound into this project which is an interesting contrast as it is a console application, but I think it helps bring life to the ASCII art characters and items and makes the world feel more alive. I hope to expand on this project in the future.![Screenshot (63)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76492881/126075129-5f550205-c846-4b29-822d-d3473bf12f2a.png)

* *__GuessingGame__* - GuessingGame is an application that gives you a quiz and will tell you if you are right or wrong.![Screenshot (66)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76492881/126075597-9f154969-fadb-40c3-af4f-1d48bf6b9e7d.png)
Whats cool about this application though was it helped introduce me to using RNG to randomize the order of things besides just numbers like randomizing which array indexes are drawn to the console first so the list is not the same everytime.

* *__DrawShapes__* * - DrawShapes will do what the title implies, draw a shape of your choosing to console. It also is customizable as the user can choose the height, width, color, and what symbol the shape is drawn with.![Screenshot (67)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76492881/126075751-05adcc73-3d0a-4fef-b163-3cc05db333df.png)
Building this application helped practice the idea of making code more modular as all of the shape drawing variables were stored outside the method and changed depending on what the user inputted.
