# **Welcome to Mack Pearson-Muggli's Portfolio! (AKA chopov1)**
>I am currently a student at Columbia College studying programming as an interactive art. This page is a collection of things I have or am currently working on.


>[My Itch.io Page](https://itch.io/profile/chopov1) is where you can play some of the games I have made for game jams. Typically I handle programming in c# & c++ as well as audio asset creation and implementation using ableton, fmod, wwise, unity and/or unreal's built in sound engine.

### *__8bit Breadboard Computer__* 
- This video shows a simple program running on an 8bit computer I put together following Ben Eater's tutorial series on youtube. This passion project took me the course of about a month to complete during the summer of my freshman year of college and taught me alot about the hardware side of programming. It also required me to put my critical thinking and problem solving skills to the test, in order to troubleshoot when things went wrong. The computer can add, subtract, retrieve and store data. The video shows me running a simple program in which the computer adds 2 and 1 giving us 3, takes that result and adds that to 2 giving us 5, then takes that result and subtracts 2 from it giving us 3. You can see the final result output to the display in Decimal.

* *__Wave File Generator__*  - This is a screenshot of a project I am currently working on in c++ with vscode. As of now it creates a new wave file, and writes data into the file. The algorithm that it uses to write data depends on the wave form the user enters. I hope to add a lot more wave forms and if anyone has any good sources on how to uncompress and read data from a wav file please reach out to me. I would love to expand this application to filtering existing files as well.
